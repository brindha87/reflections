What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	A .git file is created. For version control

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
	Staging area is an intermediate area between working directory and the repository. It allows us to add a logical group of files at a time.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
	Staging area is kind of a buffer in which we can stage a logical change in it, then commit it before staging any other logical change.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
	If you need to make experimental changes to the code while retaining a copy, you can create branches. We can checkout the branch and do code changes to it. Still we can revert to the master branch when needed.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
	With diagrams, it is easy to see master branch and other branches. Tracing back to the root and finding unreachable commit is quite easy.
	
What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?
	When we merge two branches, we get a single branch which has both the functionalities. From this point we can trace back to both of the parent branches. The diagram gives us a clear picture of the commit nodes, identifying the parent and reachable and unreachable nodes.
